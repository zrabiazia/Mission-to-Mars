# Mission-to-Mars Analysis
Overview:
Robin wants to add Mars’s hemisphere images to her current web page. I am using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolutions images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, using a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
Results:
-	 used browser to visit the URL 
-	Used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML
-	Created for loop to get the link for Mars’s Hemispheres image
-	Created dictionary to store Mars’s hemisphere URL’s and titles
-	Navigate the path through Splinter
-	Title through Splinter and got text for title
-	Append the dictionary to get four Mars’s hemisphere links and titles
-	Print URL’s with titles
-	App.py to create HTML routes
-	Convert the Jupyter notebook file to Python
-	Updated the HTML file to polish the webpage
Summary:
Mission to Mars project was to create a web site which can scrape latest news, a featured image, facts and hemisphere images; with BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Mongo DB from the Mars official website. I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape through the Mars Hemisphere’s website, selected the full resolution image and added to Robin’s webpage. VS code helped to format the Python file and  .HTML file to put the parts together and look a complete website.
